# React RRule Generator - VoiceOver fork

The following is a fork of `react-rrule-generator`, by VoiceOver. Modified a bit for our use cases.

Note running the project: you need Node v6+. It does not work on Node v14.

The following is the content of the original README.md.

## Description

This is [ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html) project based on [Create React Library](https://github.com/UdiliaInc/create-react-library) and using [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) styling. It's built with the help of a great [rrule.js](https://github.com/jakubroztocil/rrule) library.

It also uses:
* [lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash)
* [moment](https://github.com/moment/moment)
* [react-datetime](https://github.com/YouCanBookMe/react-datetime)

## Demo
https://fafruch.github.io/react-rrule-generator

## Installation

`npm install --save react-rrule-generator`

## Usage 

In your CSS index file don't forget to import styles:
```css
@import '~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';       // this lib uses boostrap (v. 4.0.0-beta.2)
@import '~react-rrule-generator/build/styles.css'; // react-rrule-generator's custom CSS
```

Then you're good to go.   
Just use it:

```js
import RRuleGenerator from 'react-rrule-generator';

// render it as it is

const SimpleRender = () => (
  <RRuleGenerator onChange={(rrule) => console.log(`RRule changed, now it's ${rrule}`)} />
);


// or with your own forms configuration

import MyCustomCalendar from './MyCustomCalendar';

const CustomizedRender = () => (
  <RRuleGenerator
    onChange={(rrule) => console.log(`RRule changed, now it's ${rrule}`)}
    config={{
      repeat: ['Monthly', 'Weekly'],
      yearly: 'on the',
      monthly: 'on',
      end: ['Never', 'On date'],
      weekStartsOnSunday: true,
      hideError: true,
    }}
    customCalendar={MyCustomCalendar}
  />
);


// you can also use it as controlled input component and feed it with your own RRule!

class ControlledRender extends Component {
  state = {
    rrule: 'SOME REALLY COOL RRULE'
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <RRuleGenerator
        onChange={(rrule) => this.setState({ rrule })}
        value={this.state.rrule}
      />
    );
  }
}
```

## API

### Props

| Name         | Type    | Description |
| ------------ | ------- | ----------- |
| **onChange** | `function` | <b>REQUIRED.</b> Callback trigger when the RRule changes. The callback receives newly generated RRule `string`.
| **value** | `string` | You can pass your own RRule value to RRuleGenerator and use it like controlled input component.
| **config** | `object` | Accepts object of what options will be rendered. This object's structure is described in [#config](#config) |
| **translations** | `function` or `object` | Accepts a function or an object with translations for all labels in the component. By default all labels are in English. You can pass your own translation object or function, which has the following signature: `(key: string, replacements: object) => string`. It receives key of the label in form of `'repeat.yearly.on_the'` and an object for placeholder replacements, e.g., `{ value: error.value }`. Example translation objects are placed in `/src/lib/translations/`. |
| **customCalendar** | `React Component` or `stateless function` | This accepts custom calendar / datepicker for choosing a date in EndOnDate view. It receives following props by default: <ul><li>`'aria-label'` with value `'Datetime picker for end on date'`,</li><li>`value` - date value consumed by app logic, </li><li>`dateFormat` - by default `'YYYY-MM-DD'`, </li><li>`locale` - `'en/ca'` or `'en/gb'` depending on if `weekStartsOnSunday` in config is set to `true` or `false` </li>
<br />
